1) Clone the repository, specifically the develop branch. You should never touch master.

> git clone -b develop https:///???????????????

2) Create a branch from this for a new feature

> git branch new_feature

> git checkout new_feature

* where new_feature is the example name given for the new branch.

** Now you can begin working on the new features.

3) In order to commit the changes to the new_feature branch.

> git status     # This shows you all changes you have made

> git add .      # The dot symbolises all

> git commit -m"Insert Message Here"

** If you need to undo a > git add, use > git reset. Commits are more tricky to undo.

4) Once happy with the new_feature, swap branches back to develop and then merge new feature into develop. Lastly, delete the local "new_feature" branch.

> git checkout develop

> git merge new_feature

> git branch -d new_feature

5) Push the changes back to the remote develop branch

> git push origin develop

6) Changes can be merged into master using github.com



Hints & Tips:

In order to make sure your local repository is up to date with the latest version of develop on the remote repository, use git pull.

> git pull basically does a > git fetch followed by a > git pull
